**The README.md lists 5 high level deployment steps. This document is not intended to provide each and every step to manually deploy SUSE OpenStack Cloud and SUSE Enterprise Storage. Rather this document provides details for developing automation to deploy SOC and SES.  Use this document as a reference while reviewing the automation.**

### 1. Prepare bootvm to for AutoYAST installs of baremetal systems
The bootvm is a CentOS7 IBM Cloud virtual server with the following configuration.
  * Additional packges installed:
    * dhcp
    * tftp-server
    * httpd
  * Configure dhcp
    * Serve IP address and PXEboot details by MAC address
  * Configure tftp-server
    * Serve SLES installer for standard and EFI bios by IP address
    * Provide links to httpd hosted install media and AutoYAST file
    * Allow tftp puts to set boot from local disk after AutoYAST install completion by IP address
    * Default to boot from local disk if there is an unknown IP address
  * Configure http
    * Serve SLES12 SP2 and SLES12 SP3 install media
    * Serve AutoYAST files for
      * kvmhost
      * soc control and compute nodes
      * ses nodes

### 2. Install kvmhost via AutoYAST file with post-install script
  * Install SLES 12 SP3 for kvmhost
  * Customized AutoYAST includes:
    * hostname
    * ntp configuration
    * Register with SUSE
    * Patterns
